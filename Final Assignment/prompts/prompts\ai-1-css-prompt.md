Please create a vibrant eye-catching, interactive CSS file for my portfolio website inspired by https://www.zachjordan.io/. I'm a student learning CSS basics and need styling for the following sections:  
Navigation bar  
Header/intro section  
About me section  
Education section  
Projects section  
Contact form  
Footer  
I'd like my website to have vibrant colors, style, and mood. Use example https://www.zachjordan.io/. Turn my projects into cards which hover on click. Make sure the layout is responsive for mobile and desktop screens. Please add helpful comments that explain what different parts of the CSS do.  
Some specific things I'd like:  
A color scheme based on the look and feel of the image provided.  
Easy-to-read fonts  
Some simple hover effects on buttons and links  
Basic responsive design (works on mobile and desktop)  
Reasonable spacing between elements  
See sample index.hmtl below.  
Thank you! */
