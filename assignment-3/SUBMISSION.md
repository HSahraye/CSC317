##Analysis

This project was primarily design-based and required me to create multiple versions for my portfolio: a fully hand-written version and two AI-generated versions. The hand-written version was both fun and time-consuming, as I had to create multiple classes to customize them using CSS selectors. In contrast, the AI-generated versions were much easier but less engaging since they mostly involved copying and pasting. The final version we were required to create was a hybrid, combining the best elements from all the previous versions. I really enjoyed this part because it gave me the flexibility to design my portfolio exactly the way I wanted.

The hand-written version took a lot of time because I realized I hadn't assigned classes to most of my sections, making it difficult to edit them using CSS selectors. I first had to go through the HTML file and properly assign classes to each section to ensure smooth customization. The AI-generated version, while requiring some refinement, was nearly perfect. It already included all the design elements I needed, and the only thing left was to personalize it to match my style.

##Lessons Learned:

From this exercise, I learned the importance of planning and structuring my HTML and CSS code. Assigning classes and IDs to different sections of the HTML file is crucial for efficient styling and customization. I also learned how to effectively use CSS variables for consistent theming and how to implement responsive design to ensure my portfolio looks good on all devices. Additionally, I gained experience in combining different design elements from multiple sources to create a cohesive and visually appealing final product.

##Preferred Version

I absolutely loved the hybrid version because it felt like I was collaborating with AI rather than letting it do all the work. It allowed me to pick and choose the best elements while discarding what I didn't need. I kept the card design from the AI-generated version because it was extremely professional and well-organized. AI-1 had an excellent color palette, so I mainly used it for its color choices and structured section layouts. AI-2, on the other hand, had a more centered, card-based design that I found very visually appealing. I especially liked AI-2â€™s organization, as it neatly arranged all the sections. In the end, I kept the centered structure from my hand-written version and used the AI-generated designs to enhance organization and color selection.
